# 8 Bit WiFi Visualizer
Open Source Hardware project for a minimalist WiFi enabled 8 Bit visualizer. My firmware displays the intensity of the packet stream for a particular AP channel, but feel free to remix the hardware or write your own firmware to bring new functionality!

This repository contains all the source files needed to reproduce this project. The PCB is designed with KiCAD and the firmware uses Arduino for the ESP8266.

This is still a work in progress, so be sure to check back for future updates!

## Current Status

This project is nearing completion, here are some of the latest updates
- Redesigned PCB for larger components to make hand soldering easier
- Recovered old firmware and tested on prototype board

## Future Goals

Here's what needs to get done for this project:
- Assemble and test latest PCB design
- Add ability in firmware to change AP channels using user button
- Finalize design and documentation
