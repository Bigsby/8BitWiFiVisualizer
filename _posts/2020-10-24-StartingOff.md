Welcome to the development blog! Here is where I will be sharing updates to the design, snippets of how to use the board, and anything else that might not fit into the documentation categories.

This blog is starting off at an interesting point: Much of the work for this project has been already completed. I have worked on this design off and on again for the better part of 2 years. Now I am approaching a somewhat "finished" state, so there might not be too many developments to share. However, I still want to have the place to write about what is going on with the design, and to share any nuggets of information that can be illustrated with this design. 

Now, where did things begin?

<h2>A brief history of the design</h2>

This project started off a few years ago when I wanted to learn more about embedded systems and networking. While studying at university, I wanted a project that used the ESP01 modules, those super popular boards that broke out a small handful of GPIO. Because of the limited GPIO, I decided on a minimalist display of only 8 LEDs, being driven by a serial input, parallel output shift register.
